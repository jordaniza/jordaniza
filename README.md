Hi, I'm Jordan, a Web3 Developer, currently technical lead at [Ambos Finance](https://ambos.finance). 

I love learning new things and new technologies. Recommendations on interesting things to read are extremely welcome.

In my free time I love music, fitness, cooking and reading weird books.

## Some of my favourite projects:

### [Auxo](https://auxo.fi)

<a href="https://github.com/AuxoDAO" target="_blank"><img alt="AuxoDAO"
src="https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-100000?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white"/></a>

- Auxo is a DeFi yield farming protocol on Ethereum that rewards stakers who participate in onchain governance.
- Auxo has a non-dilutive token model: stakers are not diluted by inflation, and instead receive rewards directly in wETH.
- Auxo was my previous focus, where I worked as a Smart Contract development lead.

### [Learn Assembly by Hacking Smart Contracts](https://jordaniza.netlify.app)

<a href="https://github.com/jordaniza/jordan-blog" target="_blank"><img alt="Website"
src="https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-100000?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white"/></a>

- This is a work-in-progress series that I've hosted on my new [Astro](https://astro.build/) blog, where I take you through writing EVM Assembly code (Yul & Bytecode) in a hands-on way.
- In it we complete challenges in the [OpenZeppelin Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com) using pure assembly, something [I have been doing myself](https://github.com/jordaniza/assemblynaut)

### Multichain SDK

<a href="https://github.com/pie-dao/monorepo/tree/main/libs/sdk-utils/multichain" target="_blank"><img alt="Multichain Repo"
src="https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-100000?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white"/></a>

- Multichain SDK allows you to fetch data from contracts deployed on multiple EVM chains simulataneously using ethers.js.
- It is designed for calling contracts with similar or shared interfaces, such as ERC20 contracts.
- Crucially, the Multichain calls preserve type-safety across calls, and works with native `Promise.AllSettled` logic for graceful errors.

### [Auxo Subgraphs](https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/jordaniza/auxo-staking/graphql)

<a href="https://github.com/jordaniza/auxo-staking-subgraph" target="_blank"><img alt="Subgraphs Rep"
src="https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-100000?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white"/></a>

- These subgraphs capture information about Auxo token holders & Auxo stakers.
- It took me a while to get my head round [The Graph](https://thegraph.com), but I'm glad that I did.
- I'm happy with how this repo turned out: especially wrapping my head around the graph's own testing and deployment workflows.
